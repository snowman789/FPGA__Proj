CRITICAL WARNING: [BD 41-759] The input pins (listed below) are either not connected or do not have a source port, and they don't have a tie-off specified. These pins are tied-off to all 0's to avoid error in Implementation flow.
Please check your design and connect them as needed: 
/Game_logic_0/ap_rst
/Game_logic_0/ap_start
/Interface_0/ap_start
